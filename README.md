# Pomodoro-timer üçÖ

This is a "Pomodoro Timer" built using Python and Tkinter. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. After several work sessions, a longer break is taken. This application helps you manage your work sessions and breaks by using a countdown timer!

**Features**

- **Work Sessions**: Default 25-minute work sessions.
- **Breaks**: Short breaks (5 minutes) after each work session and a long break (20 minutes) after every 4 sessions.

- **Progress Tracking**: Displays checkmarks (‚úî) after each completed work session to help you track your progress.
